# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a complete **movie recommendation system** using classical  
**User–User Collaborative Filtering** with **Cosine Similarity**.  
The system is fully integrated with a **FastAPI backend** and a **React + Vite frontend**,  
delivering real movie recommendations from the **MovieLens 100K dataset**.

---

## 📦 Features Implemented

###  **1. Movie Recommendations**

GET /recommend/{user_id}

Returns the top-N recommended movies for a user based on predicted ratings.

### **2. User Similarity Comparison**

GET /compare?user1=X&user2=Y

Computes cosine similarity between two users’ rating vectors.

---

# 📁 Dataset (MovieLens 100K)

This project uses the **MovieLens 100K** dataset from GroupLens.

### 🔗 Download Dataset:
👉 https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

You only need two files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `u.data` | User–item ratings (user_id, item_id, rating) |
| `u.item` | Movie titles |

### 📌 After downloading:
Place the files inside:

backend/
u.data
u.item


⚠️ These files are **NOT included in the repository** due to licensing restrictions.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Method

### ✔ 1. Build User–Item Rating Matrix
A sparse matrix R[u, i] is created where each row represents a user and each column represents a movie.

---

### ✔ 2. Compute User–User Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity between two users u and v is computed as:

sim(u, v) = (Rᵤ · Rᵥ) / ( ||Rᵤ|| × ||Rᵥ|| )


Where:
- `Rᵤ` and `Rᵥ` are rating vectors
- `·` denotes dot product
- `||Rᵤ||` is the vector magnitude of user u

---

### ✔ 3. Predict Missing Ratings

Predicted rating for user `u` on movie `i`:

r̂(u, i) = Σ[ sim(u, v) × r(v, i) ] / Σ[ |sim(u, v)| ]


The sum is taken over all neighbors v of user u who rated movie i.

---

### ✔ 4. Recommend Highest Predicted Movies
Movies with the highest predicted ratings are returned as recommendations.

**
Cosine Similarity**
sim(u, v) = (Rᵤ · Rᵥ) / ( ||Rᵤ|| × ||Rᵥ|| )

**Predicted Rating**
r̂(u, i) = Σ[ sim(u, v) × r(v, i) ] / Σ[ |sim(u, v)| ]
